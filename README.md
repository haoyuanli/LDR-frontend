# LDR-App Frontend

A React-based application that lets users sign up and complete listed activities.

To run it in development mode, run `npm start`, to build it productionally, run `npm build`.

While it is possible to deploy the backend and frontend parts of the webapp separately, it may be more convenient to simply copy over the content in the `build` folder into the `public` folder of the backend app.

## TODO

- Implement interfaces to allow users to create new activities themselves.
- Implement interfaces to allow users to modify activties that are marked as `completed`.
